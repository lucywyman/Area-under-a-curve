Area-under-a-curve
==================

Find the area under a curve selected from a menu of five equations.  User will input starting point, stopping point (bounds of integration), method of Riemann sum (trapezoidal or rectangular), precision (number of rectangles or trapezoids), and selected function.  IntegralCalculatorCLI is the same file, but with parameters passed as command line arguments.
